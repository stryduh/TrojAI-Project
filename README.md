# TrojAI-Project
## About this Project
This is an incomplete project worked on during my final undergraduate year with a Phd student. The purpose of this project is to investigate the differences in classification and neuron activation between deep learning models trained on clean data and deep learning models trained on backdoored data. For this project, convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained on the MNIST dataset and hooks were used for feature extraction to compare different layers. The CNN used was the LeNet as it was a simple model without too many layers and it also performed well on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The MNIST dataset was modified so that a filter with some kind of pattern was added to a certain percentage of each class and changing the label to a different one. For example, when training models for target class 1, 10 new MNIST datasets were created, with each dataset having a different class being modified.
